CodeAlchemist 2.0 is a revamp of the original [CodeAlchemist](https://github.com/Ryukemeister/CodeAlchemist) project. It is an online platform designed to help developers convert code from one language to another, quickly and accurately. Also with real-time code analysis, it can explain any given piece of code. Some major updates that CodeAlchemist 2.0 has is that it has been migrated to a Next.js app from previously being a Vite app and now uses a different model of the OpenAI API. The previous OpenAI model `codex` has been replaced with `text-davinci-003`. The rest of the new and upcoming features are listed below

What's new:

- Extended language options

Upcoming features:

- Include option to convert natural language into code
